This project is an evolution of the 'office-weather' project:

http://github.com/phubbard/arduino-buildbot

You can see the data at

This version is a simplification - removing the buildbot hooks,
and planning on adding an external sensor node via Xbee. For now,
mostly just simplified and cleaned up the buildbot code.

Hardware requirements:
* Arduino
* Ethernet shield
* BlinkM RGB LED (URL above)
* LM35CAZ Nice, TO-92 cased, temperature sensor with 0-5VDC output and no
   external components required. A few bucks from National.

 * Ohmic Instruments SC-600 humidity sensor and signal conditioning module.

   About $15, quite cheap for a sensor this nice. You need an external RC
   lowpass, so two more components in the circuit. See the PDF.
* Optional mini breadboard

Service requirements:
* Pachube account

Software requirements:
* Python
* Twisted
* Arduino plus BlinkM libaries

Current status and functionality:
* Poll the hardware, push an update to Pachube
* In parallel, the python code connects to the Arduino, sends the current color
  as a 3-byte RGB string, and then reads two ADC counts that correspond to temp
  and humidity readings. Units and calibration are done in the python code, as
  before.
* Nifty animated BlinkM startup sequence when you hit reset. ;)
* TAC file from deldotdr for running as a daemon

To-do:
* Xbee hardware on order - that'll be fun!
